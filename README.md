## Project structure ##  
The project follows the standard Angular structure:  
- `src` Contains the application's source code.
- `assets` Houses static assets such as images and icons.
- `app` Contains the main application components.

## Configuration ##  
The `angular.json` file contains project configuration settings.  
It's used to define build options, environments, and more.

## Development ##  
Run `ng serve` for a dev server.  
Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.  
The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Building ##  
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Functionality Overview ##  
The `app.component.ts` file contains the theme switcher functionality. The `goLight()` and `goDark()` functions toggle the theme and update the meta theme color.

## Styling ##
The app's styles are managed using SCSS. Global styles are defined in `styles.scss`, and component-specific styles are in their respective SCSS files.  
The `app.component.scss` file defines the styles for the theme switcher.  
Keyframe animations `toRight` and `toLeft` are used for smooth transitions.

## Metadata and SEO ##
The `index.html` file contains metadata and Open Graph tags for better SEO and social media sharing.
